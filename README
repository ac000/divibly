divibly is a simple program to watch DVB-T streams using libvlc & GTK.

It needs a channels.conf file in the zap format.

Run it like

    $ divibly channels.conf

Up/Down arrow moves through channels.

1-9 & 0 are mapped to the first 10 channels.

f toggles fullscreen.

z resizes the screen back to the default

s toggles subtitles.

/ shows an entry box where you can search for a channel, just start typing...
  Esc will cancel this entry.

Esc/q quits.

It has fairly simple requirements; GTK3, libVLC and xosd.
